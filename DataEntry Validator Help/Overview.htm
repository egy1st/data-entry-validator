</font></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">DC 
DataEntry Validator is a program development solution that lets you check data 
entry according to your own preferences. It lets you validate text as you type, 
limit data to specific characters, and define your own restrictions. This makes 
programming a breeze, whether you’re writing a simple script or a complex 
application. With DataEntry Validator, you can spend more time coding and less 
time looking for errors.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Customizable entry<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">
DataEntry Validator can be set to accept numeric characters from 0 to 9, and 
alphabetic characters in upper and lower case. You can also define numbers in 
decimal places and set date fields in dd/mm/yyyy format. Multiple fields can be 
separated by commas and labelled with alphanumeric names, such as “FirstNames” 
and “FamilyName.”</font></span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Quick alerts<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB">When your entry does not match your 
definitions, DataEntry Validator alerts you by changing the foreground color to 
red. Since the alert appears in the foreground, you can spot errors as you make 
them – not after you test-run the program and have to wade through pages of 
code.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Works with all 
languages<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB">DataEntry Validator can be used with all 
COM-based applications such as Delphi, Visual Basic, Borland C++, and Visual 
Basic C++. It only takes a few lines of code to set the definitions for the 
entire program, so you don’t have to keep returning to your Form Load event as 
you code.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">Easy installation and operation<br>
</font></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">DataEntry 
Validator installs automatically on Windows 98, NT, 2000, and XP. There’s no 
need to open the file separately – the program loads by itself when you open 
your application.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">To run DataEntry 
Validator on your project, select “Add Reference” from the Project menu, click 
Browse, and open the DC_DataEntryValidator10.dll file. This is usually in the 
directory C:\Windows\system32. Make sure to set the form and controls before 
starting the project.</span></h1>
